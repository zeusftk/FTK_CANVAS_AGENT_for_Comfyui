## Core Features

## Core Feature: Intelligent ComfyUI Workflow Management

After configuring ComfyUI, FTK Canvas Agent can automatically call and execute ComfyUI workflows through chat, and help workflow managers connect the entire "design - distribution - service" process, allowing high-quality ComfyUI workflows to continuously release value and reach more demand scenarios.

### üó£Ô∏è Intelligent Dialogue-driven: Lowering Thresholds, Expanding ComfyUI Workflow Coverage
- Natural language control: Users don't need complex operations, chat can trigger your ComfyUI workflow, easily reaching more potential users
- Intelligent parameter adjustment: The system automatically adapts to ComfyUI workflow parameters, reducing communication costs and improving workflow experience
- Beginner-friendly: For users without technical background, allowing your ComfyUI workflow to break through scene limitations and cover broader needs

### ‚öôÔ∏è Professional Workflow Management: Strengthening Permissions, Protecting ComfyUI Workflow Value
- Expert-level tool support: Provides complete management and encrypted distribution capabilities for ComfyUI workflows, preventing design leakage and protecting the core value of workflows
- Intelligent calls: Precisely match ComfyUI workflows according to user needs, increasing usage frequency and allowing designs to continuously play a role
- Manual designation of calls: Supports limiting the scope of ComfyUI workflow usage, can flexibly divide service modes by scene/crowd to adapt to diverse needs

### üåê Automated Services: Simplifying Processes, Improving ComfyUI Workflow Operational Efficiency
- Automatic workflow calls: After user instructions are triggered, the system automatically executes ComfyUI workflows without manual intervention, reducing service costs
- Intelligent parameter mapping: Precisely convert requirements into ComfyUI workflow parameters, reducing execution errors and improving user satisfaction and repurchase intention
- Automatic result return: ComfyUI workflow execution results are directly transmitted to users, simplifying the delivery process and helping efficiently serve more users and expand workflow service scale

### macOS Installation (todo)


## Frequently Asked Questions

### Startup Issues
**Q: What if the program cannot start?**
A: Check the integrity of the data directory and confirm that the system meets the minimum configuration requirements

**Q: The program shows: Task in progress, please wait**
A: Check the black terminal; if there are no errors, it is still running
There are two reasons for long processing time:
1. First-time use, internal models need to be compiled to tensorrt for improved running speed.
2. GPU performance constraints, such as RTX3060, it is recommended to use RTX3060 or above.
It is recommended to use the configured ComfyUI with custom workflows to see the progress of each node.
The built-in inference engine will be improved later with inference progress display.

**Q: How to solve GPU acceleration not working?**
A: Confirm if it is an NVidia graphics card and update the driver to the latest version

### Performance Issues
**Q: How to optimize slow processing speed?**
A: Close other resource-intensive programs, upgrade hardware configuration

**Q: How to solve insufficient memory?**
A: Increase virtual memory, close unnecessary applications
